# This configuration file contains default ACLs that attempt to cater
# to most setups, specifically unix authentication, samba's ldapsam backend
# and allowing users to have a shared address book
# If these ACLs don't meet your needs, please do not modify the file in-place,
# but rather make a copy, and change the include directive in slapd.conf
# This file is *not* marked as noreplace, so it will be replaced during an
# upgrade, this is done so that we can ensure that the ACLs are in sync with
# the schema files they require.

# The root DIT should be accessible to all clients
access to dn.exact=""
	by * read

# So should the schema
access to dn.subtree="cn=Subschema"

# Generic ACLs
# These ACLs should work well for any domain-based (ie dc=,dc=) suffix,
# but need adjustment and testing for any other suffix
# Note that these ACLs allow anonymous read access to most non-password 
# attributes, you may want to prevent leakage of this information by 
# removing the "by anonymous read" lines
# Regex-based ACLs also impose a performance penalty, replace
# for example dn.regex="^([^,]+,)?ou=People,(dc=[^,]+(,dc=[^,]+)*)$" with
# dn.subtree="ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" and all $2's with dc=example,dc=com
# if you need the extra performance

# Protect passwords, using a regex so we can have generic accounts with
# write access
# Openldap will not authenticate against non-userPassword attributes
# but we would have to duplicate most rules ...
