# Main configuration file for the MailScanner E-Mail Virus Scanner
#
# It's good practice to check through configuration files to make sure
# they fit with your system and your needs, whatever you expect them to
# contain.
#
# Note: If your directories are symlinked (soft-linked) in any way,
#       please put their *real* location in here, not a path that
#       includes any links. You may get some very strange error
#       messages from some of the virus scanners if you don't.
#
# Note for Version 4.00 and above:
#       A lot of the settings can take a ruleset as well as just simple
#       values. These rulesets are files containing rules which are applied
#       to the current message to calculate the value of the configuration
#       option. The rules are checked in the order they appear in the ruleset.
#
# Note for Version 4.03 and above:
#       As well as rulesets, you can now include your own functions in
#       here. Look at the directory containing Config.pm and you will find
#       CustomConfig.pm. In here, you can add your own "value" function and
#       an Initvalue function to set up any global state you need such as
#       database connections. Then for a setting below, you can put:
#               Configuration Option = &ValueFunction
#       where "ValueFunction" is the name of the function you have
#       written in CustomConfig.pm.
#

#
# Definition of variables which are substituted into definitions below.
#
# You can add any %variables% that you want to use in addition to the
# ones provided.
#
# You can also use any shell environment variables here such as $HOSTNAME
# or ${HOSTNAME} in configuration settings and rulesets. See the
# definition of "Hostname" for an example.

#
# Note: Some Symantec scanners complain (incorrectly) about "."

# If this is set to yes, then email messages passing through MailScanner

# checked *at all*, and so any viruses or other problems will be ignored.
#
# The purpose of this option is to set it to be a ruleset, so that you
# can skip all scanning of mail destined for some of your users/customers
# and still scan all the rest.

#   To:       bad.customer.com  no
#   From:     ignore.domain.com no
#   FromOrTo: default           yes
# That will scan all mail except mail to bad.customer.com and mail from

Dangerous Content Scanning = yes

# Do you want to allow partial messages, which only contain a fraction of

# There is no way to guarantee that the file fetched by the user's email
# package is free from viruses, as MailScanner never sees it.
# This feature is dangerous as it can allow viruses to be fetched from
# other Internet sites by a user's email package. The user would just
# think it was a normal email attachment and would have been scanned by

# or credit card details.
# Except it is not the real bank's web site at all, it is a very good copy
# of it run by thieves who want to steal your personal information or
# credit card details.
# These can be spotted because the real address of the link in the message
# is not the same as the text that appears to be the link.

# What to do with spam
# --------------------
#

# This is a list of actions to take when a message is spam.
# It can be any combination of the following:
#    deliver                 - deliver the message as normal
#    delete                  - delete the message
#    store                   - store the message in the quarantine
#    bounce                  - send a rejection message back to the sender
#    forward user@domain.com - forward a copy of the message to user@domain.com
#    striphtml               - convert all in-line HTML content to plain text.
#                              You need to specify "deliver" as well for the
#                              message to reach the original recipient.
#    attachment              - Convert the original message into an attachment
#                              of the message. This means the user has to take
#                              an extra step to open the spam, and stops "web
#                              bugs" very effectively.
#    notify                  - Send the recipients a short notification that
#                              spam addressed to them was not delivered. They
#                              can then take action to request retrieval of

#                              spam.
#    header "name: value"    - Add the header

#

# When trying to work out the value of configuration parameters which are
# using a ruleset, this controls the behaviour when a rule is checking the
# "To:" addresses.
# If this option is set to "yes", then the following happens when checking
# the ruleset:
#   a) 1 recipient. Same behaviour as normal.
#   b) Several recipients, but all in the same domain (domain.com for example).
#      The rules are checked for one that matches the string "*@domain.com".
#   c) Several recipients, not all in the same domain.
#      The rules are checked for one that matches the string "*@*".
#
# If this option is set to "no", then some rules will use the result they
# get from the first matching rule for any of the recipients of a message,
# so the exact value cannot be predicted for messages with more than 1
# recipient.

Debug = no

# Do you want to debug SpamAssassin from within MailScanner?
Debug SpamAssassin = no

# Set Run In Foreground to "yes" if you want MailScanner to operate
# normally in foreground (and not as a background daemon).
# Use this if you are controlling the execution of MailScanner
# with a tool like DJB's 'supervise' (see http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html).

# This option is intended for people who want to log more information
# about messages than what is put in syslog. It is intended to be used
# with a Custom Function which has the side-effect of logging information,
# perhaps to an SQL database, or any other processing you want to do
# after each message is processed.
# Its value is completely ignored, it is purely there to have side
# effects.
# If you want to use it, read CustomConfig.pm.

# When attempting delivery of outgoing messages, should we do it in the
# background or wait for it to complete? The danger of doing it in the
# background is that the machine load goes ever upwards while all the
# slow sendmail processes run to completion. However, running it in the
# foreground may cause the mail server to run too slowly.
Deliver In Background = yes

# Attempt immediate delivery of messages, or just place them in the outgoing
# queue for the MTA to deliver when it wants to?
#      batch -- attempt delivery of messages, in batches of up to 20 at once.
#      queue -- just place them in the queue and let the MTA find them.
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset. For example, you could use a
# ruleset here so that messages coming to you are immediately delivered,
# while messages going to any other site are just placed in the queue in
# case the remote delivery is very slow.
Delivery Method = batch

# Are you using Exim with split spool directories? If you don't understand

# Where to put the virus scanning engine lock files.
# These lock files are used between MailScanner and the virus signature
# "autoupdate" scripts, to ensure that they aren't both working at the

# Where to put the code for your "Custom Functions". No code in this

# How to lock spool files.
# Don't set this unless you *know* you need to.
# For sendmail, it defaults to "flock".
# For sendmail 8.13 onwards, you will probably need to change it to posix.
# For Exim, it defaults to "posix".
# No other type is implemented.

# Minimum acceptable code stability status -- if we come across code
# that's not at least as stable as this, we barf.
# This is currently only used to check that you don't end up using untested
# virus scanner support code without realising it.
# Levels used are:
# none          - there may not even be any code.
# unsupported   - code may be completely untested, a contributed dirty hack,
#                 anything, really.
# alpha         - code is pretty well untested. Don't assume it will work.
# beta          - code is tested a bit. It should work.
# supported     - code *should* be reliable.
#
# Don't even *think* about setting this to anything other than "beta" or
# "supported" on a system that receives real mail until you have tested it
# yourself and are happy that it is all working as you expect it to.
# Don't set it to anything other than "supported" on a system that could
# ever receive important mail.
#
# READ and UNDERSTAND the above text BEFORE changing this.
