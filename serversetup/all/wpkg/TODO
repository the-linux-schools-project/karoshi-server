- Make IP-based profiles:

    <host ip="192.168.2.5" profile-id="profile01" />
    
    <host ip="192.168.2-6.5-126" profile-id="profile02" />

Hostname-based profiles should have precedence over IP-based profiles (or should IPs be more important?).
Or make it configurable:

    <host order="hostname,ip" />


- Make possible to use additional config files (something like "include hosts-custom.xml" would
  include this additional .xml files, or "include hosts\*" would include all files in hosts folder)
  
  
- Make possible installing and uninstalling on a certain date (like "installdate = 23.07.2005", "uninstalldate = 01.02.2006")


- Write a client-side installer for WPKG.
  It should have the following features:
  
  1) command line for "silent" installation:
    
    - ability to specify credentials under which "cscript \\path\to\wpkg.js" will be executed
    - ability to specify the path to wpkg.js
    - no checks performed (like in GUI - below)
    
    Examples:
    
    wpkg-install.exe --user Administrator --pass s3crEt --path \\server\wpkg
    wpkg-install.exe --user Administrator --pass s3crEt --path \\192.168.111.200\wpkg
    wpkg-install.exe --user Administrator --pass s3crEt --path P:\wpkg
    

  2) GUI:
  
    - it should check, if cscript (needed to run wpkg.js) is available in the system (if it isn't notify the user)
    - it should ask for the path to wpkg.js, and credentials
    - the installer should support many languages, defined in language.lang file (like en.lang, de.lang, pl.lang etc.)
      New languages should be easily added by just copying a new language file to a directory with the installer.
    
  Any takers? :)


- Complete the web interface... use LDAP for that... ideas?
