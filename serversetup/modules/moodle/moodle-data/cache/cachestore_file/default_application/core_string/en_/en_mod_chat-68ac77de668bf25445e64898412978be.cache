The chat may be a one-time activity or it may be repeated at the same time each day or each week. Chat sessions are saved and can be made available for everyone to view or restricted to users with the capability to view chat session logs.

Chats are especially useful when the group chatting is not able to meet face-to-face, such as

* Regular meetings of students participating in online courses to enable them to share experiences with others in the same course but in a different location
* A student temporarily unable to attend in person chatting with their teacher to catch up with work
* Students out on work experience getting together to discuss their experiences with each other and their teacher
* Younger children using chat at home in the evenings as a controlled (monitored) introduction to the world of social networking
* A question and answer session with an invited speaker in a different location
* Sessions to help students prepare for tests where the teacher, or other students, would pose sample questions";s:15:"modulename_link";s:13:"mod/chat/view";s:16:"modulenameplural";s:5:"Chats";s:19:"neverdeletemessages";s:21:"Never delete messages";s:11:"nextsession";s:22:"Next scheduled session";s:26:"no_complete_sessions_found";s:27:"No complete sessions found.";s:8:"noguests";s:30:"The chat is not open to guests";s:6:"nochat";s:13:"No chat found";s:10:"nomessages";s:15:"No messages yet";s:15:"normalkeepalive";s:9:"KeepAlive";s:12:"normalstream";s:6:"Stream";s:18:"noscheduledsession";s:20:"No scheduled session";s:13:"notallowenter";s:43:"You are not allowed to enter the chat room.";s:9:"notlogged";s:22:"You are not logged in!";s:27:"nopermissiontoseethechatlog";s:47:"You don't have permission to see the chat logs.";s:7:"oldping";s:18:"Disconnect timeout";s:15:"page-mod-chat-x";s:20:"Any chat module page";s:9:"pastchats";s:18:"Past chat sessions";s:20:"pluginadministration";s:19:"Chat administration";s:10:"pluginname";s:4:"Chat";s:11:"refreshroom";s:12:"Refresh room";s:15:"refreshuserlist";s:17:"Refresh user list";s:14:"removemessages";s:19:"Remove all messages";s:11:"repeatdaily";s:26:"At the same time every day";s:10:"repeatnone";s:44:"No repeats - publish the specified time only";s:11:"repeattimes";s:28:"Repeat/publish session times";s:12:"repeatweekly";s:27:"At the same time every week";s:6:"saidto";s:7:"said to";s:12:"savemessages";s:18:"Save past sessions";s:10:"seesession";s:16:"See this session";s:4:"send";s:4:"Send";s:7:"sending";s:7:"Sending";s:10:"serverhost";s:11:"Server name";s:8:"serverip";s:9:"Server ip";s:9:"servermax";s:9:"Max users";s:10:"serverport";s:11:"Server port";s:8:"sessions";s:13:"Chat sessions";s:12:"sessionstart";s:40:"The next chat session will start in {$a}";s:15:"strftimemessage";s:5:"%H:%M";s:17:"studentseereports";s:31:"Everyone can view past sessions";s:22:"studentseereports_help";s:87:"If set to No, only users have mod/chat:readlog capability are able to see the chat logs";s:4:"talk";s:4:"Talk";s:12:"updatemethod";s:13:"Update method";s:10:"updaterate";s:12:"Update rate:";s:8:"userlist";s:9:"User list";s:9:"usingchat";s:10:"Using chat";s:14:"usingchat_help";s:759:"The chat module contains some features to make chatting a little nicer.

* Smilies - Any smiley faces (emoticons) that you can type elsewhere in Moodle can also be typed here, for example :-)
* Links - Website addresses will be turned into links automatically
* Emoting - You can start a line with "/me" or ":" to emote, for example if your name is Kim and you type ":laughs!" or "/me laughs!" then everyone will see "Kim laughs!"
* Beeps - You can send a sound to other participants by clicking the "beep" link next to their name. A useful shortcut to beep all the people in the chat at once is to type "beep all".
* HTML - If you know some HTML code, you can use it in your text to do things like insert images, play sounds or create different coloured text";s:10:"viewreport";s:23:"View past chat sessions";}
