Notes on handling of multiple attempts:

* The option to start a new attempt is provided by a checkbox above the Enter button on the content structure page, so be sure you're providing access to that page if you want to allow more than one attempt.
* Some SCORM packages are intelligent about new attempts, many are not. What this means is that if the learner re-enters an existing attempt, if the SCORM content does not have internal logic to avoid overwriting previous attempts they can be overwritten, even though the attempt was 'completed' or 'passed'.
